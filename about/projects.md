# Some of my projects

Here are some of my projects

## On Github

Here are some handy stuff used by me at most every day for my typical activity: data formats convert, analyze python code, keeping information and code sources database (work these tools is still in *very* progress ðŸ™‚)

  * [objdc](https://github.com/meechanic/objdc) - data cross-convertation tool (supported formats: YAML, JSON, TOML, Separated Values)
  * [augmentdb](https://github.com/meechanic/augmentdb) - command line tools for augmenting JSON object lists by each other (including some tools for working with filesystem with JSON output). Applicable at least for marking files with additional metainformation
  * [dipperpy](https://github.com/meechanic/dipperpy) - Extract data about modules, functions classes and call graph from python source. Outputs it in JSON format
  * [inderdb](https://github.com/meechanic/interdb) - API for information sources keeping and systematization (books, articles, software packages etc.)
