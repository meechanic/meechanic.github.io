# Some of my projects

Here are some of my projects

## On Github

Here are some handy stuff used by me at most every day for my typical activity: data formats convert, analyze python code, systematizatize information and code sources in the special database (work on these tools is still in *very* progress 🙂)

  * [objdc](https://github.com/meechanic/objdc) - data cross-convertation tool (supported formats: YAML, JSON, TOML, Separated Values)
  * [dipperpy](https://github.com/meechanic/dipperpy) - Extract data about modules, functions classes and call graph from python source. Outputs it in JSON format
