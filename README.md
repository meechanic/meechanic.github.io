# Yet Another Homepage

My name is Mikhail Efremov, I'm software engeneer.

My professional interests are concentrated around development of various backend APIs and clients fot them (mostly in Python).

I'm a big fan of UNIX-like systems. For a long time I work as a system administrator of large systems based on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

I prefer text user interface to GUI. Really. I'm not a frontend or GUI developer, but I really love Terminals and Consoles.

My personal interest are: non-fiction books, mostly about science and scientists' biographies.
Also, I love mathematics and physics and there are so much wonderful things to explore in depth for me in this areas :)
